# pvm-net

## Introduction
This work is based on our paper EGNet: 3D Semantic Segmentation via Point-Voxel-Mesh on DataEuclidean-Geodesic Feature Fusion (pvm-net), which consists of Euclidean and geometric modules, combining the advantages of surface graph convolution in geometric space and point cloud sparse voxel convolution in Euclidean space.

## Installation
Our model environment settings are consistent with [VMNet](https://github.com/hzykent/VMNet).

## Acknowledgements
Our code is built upon [VMNet](https://github.com/hzykent/VMNet), [torch-geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric), [torchsparse](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchsparse) and [dcm-net](https://github.com/JonasSchult/dcm-net).
